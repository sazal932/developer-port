            <p>As a young child, my dream occupation was to dig up dinosaurs. As I grew older and my interests changed, my dream profession changed also. Although most of these dreams were not very long lived, one occupational dream has outlasted all others, and has finally emerged as the dream I passionately pursue.</p>

                <p>First things first, web development is basically about linking things together. If you get how to link pages to each other, styles to pages and the database to your code, you have a fair knowledge of things. Therefore, try to understand things like how HTML pages are linked to the code in JavaScript or Python or PHP. Then, you have to understand the linking of CSS or bootstrap styles to the HTML pages. Finally, try to make out how all this ends up being connected to the database</p>
